## Presentation 1
### Pixel Stellar

- Topic 1: What is Noise? (05 minutes):
  - Different types of noise (white noise,  rigid fractal noise, cellular automata, etc.)
    - Perlin Noise as the main topic of the presentation.
  - Brief discussion on how pure randomness is different from perlin noise
- Topic 2: Perlin Noise (05 minutes):
  - Original function written by Ken Perlin
    - Brief information on Ken Perlin as a computer scientist
  - Created in 1983 for the CGI film *Tron (1982)*
  - Improvement to the algorithm in 2002
- Topic 3: Why Perlin Noise? (10 minutes):
  - In-depth comparison to pure randomness
    - White Noise is too rough for video games
    - Perlin Noise creates smooth transitions between random values (better for video games)
  - Spatial Coherence (smooth transitions)
    - Essential for natural looking generation in video games
  - Applications in video games
    - Terraria world generation
    - Minecraft world generation
    - (Possible) other world generation
- Topic 4: The Algorithm (25 minutes):
  - 1D generation
  - Start with array of randomly generated numbers
    - These can be viewed as the slope of a linear equation
  - Linear interpolation can be used to generate values between the slopes
    - This creates what looks like a smoother line of a function
  - Smooth step function can be used to further smooth the transition near the slopes
  - Octaves can be added to create more variation to the smooth curve
  - Extension into 2D
    - Grid of unit (directional) vectors instead of slopes
  

## Presentation 2
### Stragglers

- Topic 1: Introduction to maze generation using proc gen (5 mins)
  - Show different examples of procedural generation algorithms and what their mazes look like
  - Brief mention of minimum spanning trees (Prim’s and Kruscal’s) and depth-search algorithms
  - Problems with these algorithms when creating a maze → biased towards short dead ends/ long corridors
- Topic 2: Overview of Wilson’s Algorithm (10 mins)
  - Uniform spanning trees - what they are/why we would want to use this in our game
  - How Wilson’s Alg works
      - Series of random walks that add cells to the UST
      - After a walk is completed, it is stepped through again and loops are erased from the path
- Topic 3: Implementation (25 mins)
  - steps:
    1) Choose a random starting cell and add it to the uniform spanning tree
    2) Choose another cell that has not been added yet and do a random walk until reaching the UST
    3) Keep track of direction as each cell is added → will allow for removing loops 
        - Once a walk has been found, go through again following the directions and disregard any cells that are not needed
        - Add the remaining touched cells in the walk to the UST
    4) Repeat b and c until all cells have been added
  - Include examples/visuals of different ways the algorithm can play out with different-sized mazes
- Topic 4: Conclusion (5 mins)
  - Pros and cons of Wilson’s 


## Presentation 3
### Pirates

- Topic 1: Introduction + History (12 minutes):
  - Brief history of algorithm
    - Model synthesis (2007)
    - Wave function collapse (2016)
      - Evolution from model synthesis to WFC
    - Ties to quantum computing
      - Wave function collapse overview
      - How WFC models quantum particle behavior
    - Reasons for choosing algorithm
      - WFC vs perlin noise and the needs of our game
- Topic 2: Wave Function Collapse Example (15 minutes):
  - What is entropy in WFC
    - How we choose the next tile
    - Effects of collapsing a tile on entropy
  - Writing WFC rules
    - Hard-coded rules vs. dynamic sample
      - pros and cons of each approach
        - hard-coded is less flexible but simpler
        - dynamic sample is resuable, reduces rewriting code for new tilemap environments but more complex to implement
  - Animated example walkthrough of algorithm
    - entropy comparison at beginning, each step, and end state
- Topic 3: Code Explanation + Walkthrough (15 minutes):
  - Tailoring WFC
    - Weighing tiles, seeding pathways + fixed landmarks
- Topic 4: Conclusion (3 min)
  - Pros and cons

### Cuscuta

- Topic 1: Introduction + Overview (7 minutes)
  - Topic Overview
    - Start Room Spawning
    - Random Room Spawning
    - Inner Walls
    - Backtracking
  - Runtime of creating world map & storing rooms
    - Diagram showing scaled-down world map and room additions
    - Explanation of basic data storage
  - Overall Generation Ideas 
    - Why we chose room by room generation & not complete generation on spawn
  - Markov Chains
    - Uses probability-based transitions and an initial state to determine the next room type using previous data 
    - Examples, such as word prediction/autocomplete
- Topic 2: Spawning Start Room (15 minutes)
  - Generating doors in start room
    - Tagging each door by type and explain utilization
